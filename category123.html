                            near Caspar, California. Historians have called it "the most significant shipwreck on the
                            west coast".Its shipwreck site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places
                            as Frolic (brig) in 1991.
                            The ship was built in Baltimore.
                            It was on return from trading in China with a load of porcelain and perhaps opium when it sank.</p>

                        <p>The vintage revolutionar painting featuring General George washington riding through camp at valley forge.
                            Valley Forge functioned as the third of eight winter encampments for the Continental Army's main
                            body, commanded by General George Washington, during the American Revolutionary War.
                            In September 1777, Congress fled Philadelphia to escape the British capture of the city.
                            After failing to retake Philadelphia, Washington led his 12,000-man army into winter quarters at
                            Valley Forge, located approximately 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Philadelphia.
                            They remained there for six months, from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778.
                            At Valley Forge, the Continentals struggled to manage a disastrous supply crisis while
                            retraining and reorganizing their units. About 1,700 to 2,000 soldiers died from disease,
                            possibly exacerbated by malnutrition.</p>

                        <h3>The Scream</h3>
                        <p> Artist: Edvard Munch
                            Year: 1893
                            Popularly known as “The Scream,” Norwegian artist Edvard Munch’s expressionist masterpiece is
                            frequently interpreted as a primal response to the excessive pressures of modern life. Originally
                            titled “The Shriek of Nature,” the image was created with an entirely different intent, as related
                            by Munch himself, “One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below.
                            I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord—the sun was setting, and the clouds
                            turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream.
                            I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked.” The iconic painting
                            was stolen from the Oslo National Gallery in 1994; the culprit was apprehended and the painting recovered
                            several months later. Ironically, a 1910 version of “The Scream” was taken in broad daylight from the
                            Munch Museum in 2004. It, too, was eventually recovered despite fears it had been destroyed.</p>

                        <h3>The Ambassadors</h3>
                        <p> Artist: Hans Holbein the Younger
                            - Year: 1533
                            The most in-demand portrait painter of his era, Hans Holbein spent a considerable amount of time at the
                            court of Henry VIII. “The Ambassadors” depicts Jean de Dinteville, the French ambassador to England, and
                            his friend, George de Selve, both in their late 20s; de Selve, the bishop of Lavaur, served as ambassador
                            to both the Holy Roman emperor and the pope.
                            The painting is scattered with allegorical components, including a lute with broken strings—perhaps symbolic
                            of Henry VIII’s break with Rome so that he could divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry his mistress,
                            Anne Boleyn. The blurry, black-and-white object that bisects the bottom of the composition is, in fact,
                            a human skull, representing mortality. Striking use of anamorphosis, it can only be viewed from an acute
                            angle, forcing observers to view the painting from a variety of perspectives.
