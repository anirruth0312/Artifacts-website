                        <p>The sofa features three seats, each seat backed with an upholstered cushion and set within a backrest
                            formed from crossed antlers. The armrests and remaining structure of the sofa is likewise formed
                            from antlers, while the cushions feature fine floral upholstery.
                            The earliest extant example of furniture made from antlers is a chandelier in the Cathedral at Erfurt,
                            which dates to the 15th Century. Although such pieces were popular over the following centuries, the
                            first known suite of furniture made from antlers dates only to about 1830. The popularity of antler-seat
                            suites soared after the Great Exhibition of 1851, wherein antler furniture featured prominently.
                            The present sofa can be combined with a pair of matching side chairs, available here, as well as a coffee
                            table, available here.</p>

                        <h3>Desk from Napoleon III period</h3>
                        <p>The desk demonstrates eclectic influences—a characteristic common to art of the Second Empire—with forms
                            and ideas derived from the Renaissance to the Rococo. In particular, the espagnolette mounts that adorn
                            the shoulders of the legs are a Rococo period influence, while the pietra dura inlays upon the apron is
                            rooted in the Renaissance.
                            The desk features a red leather plateau encompassed by an ormolu frame. The shaped apron below is inset to the front with a narrow
                            drawer, which is flanked by two faux drawers. Strikingly, the faces of the drawer and the flanking panels are inset with pietra dura,
                            or polychrome hardstone inlays, which in this instance have been arranged in elaborate and beautiful floral compositions.
                            Similar inlays adorn the apron to the back and sides of the desk. The apron is set with fine ormolu mounts in the Rococo style,
                            with the central drawer flanked by twin masks contained within scrolling rocaille forms. The shoulders of the ebonised wood legs
                            are mounted with ormolu espagnolettes, while the cabriole legs terminate in foliate sabots.</p>

                            with rockwork and flanked by putti with further swags, the mirrors centred by a balcony with a female
                            figure of Columbine reaching downwards towards standing figures of Harlequin and Pierrot and with further
                            rock-work and acanthus wrapped C and S-scroll divisions, the base centred by a shell and C-scroll class
                            The over-mantel mirror follows the design published by Thomas Chippendale (d. 1779), in the 3rd edition of his Director (1762),
                            plate CLXXXII. Chippendale specified that the 'Imbossments must be very bold, and the Foliage neatly laid down'. Although he did
                            not elaborate on the design, the characters displayed in the mirror are Columbine, Harlequin and Pierrot, whose amorous misadventures
                            were a common theme in the Commedia dell'Arte, the Italian theatre that originated in the mid 16th century and remained popular in Europe
                            during the 18th and 19th centuries. Episodes from the works were commonly depicted in art, from Callot's etchings of the early 17th century
                            to Picasso's Three Musicians, 1921, and they were frequently subjects for porcelain groups. The mirror was in the collection of Captain
                            Napier George Henry Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington (d. 1940) at Crichel House, Dorset.  .  </p>
